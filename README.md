# gabes_firstpackage

gabes_firstpackage is my first attempt at creating a package. I chose to use my first Multilayer Perceptron code for this package, whose objective was to help me learn OOP and to improve my understading of neural networks, the backpropagation algorithm and its equations. 

This also my first time using a repository (and therefore GitHub). Long story short: this project is not supposed to be anything fancy, it's just a personal project so I can hone my Python skills an refresh some knowledge.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](git+https://github.com/sundae-driver/myfirstpackage.git#egg=myfirstpackage) to install myfirstpackage.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sundae-driver/myfirstpackage.git#egg=myfirstpackage


```
