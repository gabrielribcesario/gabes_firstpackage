# myfirstpackage

MyFirstPackage is my first attempt at creating a package. I chose to use my first MLP code for this package, whose objective was to help me learn OOP and to improve my understading of neural networks, the backpropagation algorithm and its equations. It's not supposed to be anything fancy.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](git+https://github.com/sundae-driver/myfirstpackage.git#egg=myfirstpackage) to install myfirstpackage.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sundae-driver/myfirstpackage.git#egg=myfirstpackage
```
